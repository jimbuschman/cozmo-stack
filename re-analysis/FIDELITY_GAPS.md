# Open fidelity gaps

Do not edit by hand: edit the manifest and regenerate, or the two will disagree.

Manifest of **205 records** over 16 subsystems.

| status | records | meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| EXACT_SOURCE | 157 | Read from primary source and reproduced. The record names the address, asset or schema it was read from. |
| EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | 14 | The native behaviour is known from primary source and this stack reaches the same observable effect by a different mechanism. The record names the difference, and the difference has to be one a listener, a viewer or the robot cannot tell apart. |
| RECOVERABLE_GAP | 3 | A behaviour-affecting decision whose answer plausibly exists in primary source that has not been read, or has been read too shallowly to settle it. The work outstanding is reverse engineering. |
| IMPLEMENTATION_GAP | 1 | The native behaviour is established from primary evidence, and the production implementation knowingly does something else. The work outstanding is building it. This is unfinished fidelity work, not a policy. |
| COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | 19 | A deliberate product or platform decision this stack intends to keep: offline tools, the test harness, PC-side plumbing, or a stand-in the operator has to ask for. Not a place to put fidelity work that is hard. |
| HARDWARE_ONLY | 3 | No shipped artifact can settle it; only a robot, or a recording of the stock app, can. |
| BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | 8 | The answer lies in third-party code or data that is not in the package (Omron OKAO, the Wwise runtime DSP, the Acapela text-to-speech engine). |

## Where each subsystem stands

Four separate things, because one word cannot carry them. **Source read** means nothing is left that
reading the original would settle. **Built** means nothing the original is known to do is knowingly
not done here. Neither says the behaviour is faithfully reproduced: the last two columns are what
remains after both, and they do not go away by working harder on this repository.

## Still to read: every RECOVERABLE_GAP

Each of these is a question the original can answer and nobody has asked it yet.

### M6-wwise-bank — Wwise bank reading and codecs

**M6-003 — Stereo IMA ADPCM is refused, and eight robot sound effects are silent because of it** (live path)

* where: `cozmo-stack/src/Cozmo.Robot/Animation/Wwise/WwiseAdpcm.cs`
* effect: eight shipped Robot_SFX events make no sound at all: the effort grunts, the spark launch and the four scan sounds
* rests on: mono ADPCM decodes; stereo is refused because the block layout was not established
* best authority: the seven shipped stereo ADPCM files themselves, which are the thing that would settle the layout: IMA ADPCM block packing is arithmetic that a file either fits or does not
* evidence: wwise --coverage: Play__Robot_SFX__Effort_Long, Effort_Medium, Effort_Fail, Spark_Launch, Scan_Loop_Play, Scan_Start, Scan_Stop, Scan_Single; wwise --validate: 7 files, "ADPCM with 2 channels is not decoded"
* outstanding: the stereo block layout. An earlier version of this record said no robot event reaches such a file; the coverage tool now lists the eight that do, which is what corrected it

### M11-vision — Markers, camera geometry and BlockWorld

**M11-005 — Front-end pixel algorithms, the 0.75 dark multiplier and PnP numerics** (live path)

* where: `cozmo-stack/src/Cozmo.Robot/Vision/QuadDetector.cs`
* effect: markers are found at slightly different places, or not found
* rests on: local implementations of steps the engine parameterises
* best authority: MarkerDetector::Parameters::Initialize gives the parameters, which are read; the pixel loops themselves were not transcribed
* evidence: MarkerDetector::Parameters::Initialize
* outstanding: the engine own quad extraction and refinement, which is in the binary

### M14-faces — Face and pet pipeline

**M14-007 — The memory map is not modelled, so CanDriveIdealDistanceForward always allows the drive** (live path)

* where: `cozmo-stack/src/Cozmo.Robot/Behavior/FaceBehaviors.cs:256`
* effect: the robot drives towards a face into an obstacle it should have known about
* rests on: deferred
* best authority: the engine memory map
* outstanding: the memory map structure and the query

## Still to build: every IMPLEMENTATION_GAP

Each of these is a question already answered. The original's behaviour is established and this stack knowingly does something else, so the work outstanding is writing it, not reading.

### M9-wwise-music — Wwise music, the MIDI sampler and singing

**M9-021 — A music event with several Play actions renders only the first** (not on the live path)

* where: `cozmo-stack/src/Cozmo.Robot/Animation/Wwise/WwiseMusic.cs`
* effect: Play__Codelab__Music_Tiny_Orchestra_Init plays one of its nine layers
* rests on: a reduction of this stack on the music path. Ordinary events no longer reduce this way: WwisePlayback plays every Play target together
* best authority: the shipped bank lists all nine Play actions, and the ordinary-event walk already shows the shape the music path needs. Singing is unaffected, which is why this is off the live path: each of the three tempo events holds exactly one Play action
* evidence: Play__Codelab__Music_Tiny_Orchestra_Init: 9 Play actions and 9 of type 0x1901; Play__Robot_VO__Cozmo_Singing_80bpm, _100bpm and _120bpm: one Play action each; nothing in cozmo-stack posts a Codelab music event
* outstanding: the music resolver has to carry every Play action rather than the first; nothing is left to read

## What remains after both: blocked externally, or needing hardware

| id | subsystem | status | what | why it cannot be settled here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M3-008 | M3-device | HARDWARE_ONLY | Scanline parity: dd written as 01 | whether the firmware selects a physical row from the bit position; only the panel can show this |
| M3-016 | M3-device | HARDWARE_ONLY | Colour camera frames are half-width three-component JPEG | no colour capture exists; the robot has only ever been asked for grayscale |
| M9-013 | M9-wwise-music | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | Whether Wwise routes MIDI notes into the get-in branch of the singing sampler | the dispatch rule itself. Only a recording of the stock app singing, or a Wwise runtime of this bank version, can settle it. This is the largest remaining doubt about how a rendered song sounds |
| M9-014 | M9-wwise-music | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | Whether a note's velocity changes anything, when nothing in the bank binds it | whether Wwise applies a velocity-to-level mapping of its own to a MIDI voice. The shipped songs vary velocity over about 20 units, so if it does, some notes are a few dB quieter than this renders them. Only a Wwise runtime of this bank version, or a recording of the stock app, can settle it. Until the M9 re-audit this was recorded as an equivalent implementation, which the varying velocities do not support |
| M9-022 | M9-wwise-music | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | Container semantics: blend and actor-mixer play all children, random picks one by weight avoiding the last, sequence steps its playlist | the runtime dispatch rule, in particular whether a container pre-filters its playlist to children that accept a MIDI note or picks first and then filters |
| M9-023 | M9-wwise-music | HARDWARE_ONLY | How the stock app sounded when it sang | sustain, release tails, level and whether the get-in branch is audible during a song |
| M9-024 | M9-wwise-music | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | Whether cozmo_singing_note_off also stops the voice it is attached to | the name of modulator property 15 and the enumeration of its values, which live in the Wwise SDK; no Wwise runtime or header ships in the APK. What is left open is only whether the stop is this modulator or the break-on-note-off bit, not whether the note stops |
| M9-025 | M9-wwise-music | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | The shape a Wwise LFO produces between its extremes | whether the output is unipolar or bipolar, and the exact waveform. This is on the live path: the cube shake is measured and the vibrato reaches a playing song, so any shake exercises this shape |
| M9-026 | M9-wwise-music | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | The filter and limiter arithmetic between the shipped settings | the exact coefficient formulas and detector behaviour. The settings they act on are exact, so the shape is right and the detail is not |
| M11-016 | M11-vision | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | Face, pet and motion detection | nothing recoverable: the detector is third-party binary code |
| M14-006 | M14-faces | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | Text to speech is not implemented | the voice model and the plug-in are third-party binaries |

## Settled differences: equivalent implementations and kept policies

| id | subsystem | status | what | why it is settled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1-013 | M1-transport | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Windows high-resolution timer and the tick loop | none needed: the engine runs on Android and this is the local equivalent |
| M1-014 | M1-transport | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Three-thread dispatch, handler isolation, socket error handling | the engine threading is its own; nothing on the wire depends on it |
| M1-015 | M1-transport | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | 5 s connect timeout | the engine connect timeout was not read; nothing the robot does depends on it |
| M3-004 | M3-device | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Warm-up frames are flagged, and delivered like any other | RobotToEngineImplMessaging::HandleImageChunk and VisionComponent::SetNextImage, read |
| M3-013 | M3-device | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | TargetInFlight 10, counter-paced feed, Busy window 200 ms, priming | the engine feeds to its own budget every update (UpdateStream 0x0057C84C) |
| M3-017 | M3-device | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Test tones, beeps and sweeps | not applicable |
| M4-004 | M4-control | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Motion is gated on calibration here; the engine reacts to it instead | HandleMotorCalibration 0x00536A68, BehaviorReactToMotorCalibration 0x006065F0, and the callers of IsHeadCalibrated / IsLiftCalibrated, all read |
| M4-005 | M4-control | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Action ids cycle 1..255 | the engine action id allocation |
| M4-006 | M4-control | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Wheel confirmation tolerance 35 percent / 5 mm per s | not applicable: the engine does not confirm wheel speeds this way |
| M4-007 | M4-control | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | StopAll sends StopAllMotors and a zero DriveWheels | the engine stop path |
| M4-009 | M4-control | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | Cube tracking from ObjectAvailable and ObjectConnectionState | HandleActiveObjectAvailable 0x0053391C, HandleActiveObjectConnectionState 0x00533B3C, HandleActiveObjectMoved 0x00533E30 and HandleObjectPowerLevel 0x00537130, read |
| M5-018 | M5-animation | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | How many frames one wall-clock tick streams | the engine streams to the audio budget on every update regardless of the clock (UpdateStream 0x0057C84C) |
| M5-020 | M5-animation | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Expressions helper faces | not applicable |
| M5-021 | M5-animation | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | The eye and its lids are filled by scanline, not by cv::fillConvexPoly | ProceduralFaceDrawer::DrawEye 0x005850E0, read |
| M6-002 | M6-wwise-bank | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | Vorbis rebuild with external codebooks and granule computation | the Wwise Vorbis packing; no runtime in the package to check against |
| M6-004 | M6-wwise-bank | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | Resampling to the robot rate is a band-limited windowed sinc, not Audiokinetic resampler | the Wwise runtime resampler, which does not ship in the APK. What was fixed here is a defect of this stack, not a reproduction of theirs: nearest-sample decimation aliases, and no competent resampler does |
| M7-015 | M7-behaviour | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | Pick-up falls back to the raw status flag until the off-treads classifier is enabled | Robot::CheckAndUpdateTreadsState 0x00511E00, which is implemented and used once calibration is reported |
| M8-004 | M8-framework | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Behaviours built in code carry a score of their own; the engine's default is zero | IBehavior::IBehavior 0x005BBB74 and IBehavior::EvaluateScoreInternal 0x005BEEC2, read |
| M8-008 | M8-framework | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | The head recalibration wait: the engine has no timeout, this stack keeps a backstop | CalibrateMotorAction::CheckIfDone 0x00547D38 and IAction::IAction 0x00540C44, read |
| M8-009 | M8-framework | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Behaviour scope undo order | the engine Smart* destructor order |
| M8-010 | M8-framework | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Behaviour inventory classifier rules | not applicable: this is bookkeeping, not robot behaviour |
| M9-011 | M9-wwise-music | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | The render goes through the effect chain the robot bus carries, not a local peak normalisation | libcozmoEngine.so for the routing and Init.bnk for the chain and its parameters |
| M9-016 | M9-wwise-music | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | A song is rendered as it plays, a block at a time, about 66 ms ahead of the clock | BehaviorSinging::UpdateInternal 0x005EF0C8 posts Cozmo_Singing_Vibrato every tick, and the bank binds that parameter to the depth of the LFO on the sampler pitch. Continuous is what the engine does, and this reproduces it. The 66 ms is this stack's choice, and it is small against the engine's own: UpdateAmountToSend 0x0057C6F0 lets the engine run up to 14 audio frames ahead of what the robot has played, which at 744 samples and 22320 Hz is 467 ms of audio already committed before it is heard. A parameter cannot reach audio either stack has already sent |
| M9-018 | M9-wwise-music | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | A Stop action ends the streaming song when its target is the Play target or an ancestor | the shipped bank. The three tempo events play targets 914766641, 139286641 and 602865028, and Stop__Robot_VO__Cozmo_Singing_Stop holds three action-type-1 actions targeting exactly those three, so every stop the product can post is a direct hit on the container that is playing |
| M9-020 | M9-wwise-music | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | A clip plays its source from BeginTrim for its length; a note still held at the clip end is released there | the shipped clip fields, which are read exactly. Every clip in every bank has PlayAt 0 and BeginTrim 0, so the start of the window is never moved; the end of it is what makes a twelve-second song out of a MIDI source minutes long, and is far from decorative. The one part of the rule that is a runtime judgement - what becomes of a note still held at the end - reaches two notes in the whole product, and the segment ends at the same instant, so what they would have sounded past it is outside the rendered song under either reading |
| M9-027 | M9-wwise-music | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | Robot_Bus_Eq_HiLowPass low-pass at 14298 Hz is above Nyquist for the robot's rate | Init.bnk gives 14298 Hz; AnimConstants::AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE gives 22320 Hz, so Nyquist is 11160 Hz in the engine too |
| M10-005 | M10-derived | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | The off-treads debounce runs on the local clock | the engine debounces against its own base-station clock in milliseconds; the same quantity, a different source |
| M11-012 | M11-vision | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | The nominal camera calibration stand-in | not applicable: the live path reads the robot own calibration and fails closed without it |
| M11-013 | M11-vision | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | AllowUnconnectedObjects switch | the engine connected-object rule, which is implemented |
| M12-014 | M12-manipulation | EQUIVALENT_IMPLEMENTATION | The docking error signal's last two bytes are whatever was on the engine's stack | UpdateDockingErrorSignal 0x0063BE80 is the only builder and it never writes the struct bytes at +0x14 and +0x15. Nothing clears the struct either: it is a stack local at sp+0xa0 filled field by field, with no memclr and no constructor call, and Pack 0x007C0B26 reads both bytes and sends them |
| TOOL-001 | tools | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Conformance CLI pass and fail criteria | not applicable: the harness is not part of the app |
| TOOL-002 | tools | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | The fake robot side answers place docks without a marker signal | not applicable: this is the test double, not the robot |
| TOOL-003 | tools | COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | The --nominal calibration override in the vision, manipulation and freeplay tools | the live path fails closed without a real calibration |
